## Dependencies
Codes released in this work is trained and tested on:
- Ubuntu Linux
- Python 3.8.15
- Pytorch 1.13.0
- NVIDIA CUDA 11.6
- 1x NVIDIA GeForce rtx 2080 ti GPU
## Prerequisites
- Dataset: Please download the [dataset](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/computer-vision-and-machine-learning/research/zero-shot-learning/zero-shot-learning-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly), and change `--dataroot` to your local path. Please refer to [SDGZSL](https://github.com/uqzhichen/SDGZSL) for the finetuned features.
- Semantic: The semantics for AWA2, SUN, and APY are available in the datasets. Please download the 1024-D [CUB semantic](https://github.com/Hanzy1996/CE-GZSL) and save it to the data path.

## Train and Test
Please run the scripts in `./scripts` to reproduce the results in the paper, e.g.,
```
sh ./scripts/AWA2.sh
```
